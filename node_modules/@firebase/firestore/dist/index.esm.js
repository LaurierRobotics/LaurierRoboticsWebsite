/**
 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can
 * create, replace, delete, and update subsets of documents.
 *
 * Mutations not only act on the value of the document but also its version.

 * the existing version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. For Delete
 * mutations, we reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN
 *
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * SetMutation        NoDocument(v3)        Document(v0)
 * SetMutation        null                  Document(v0)
 * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * PatchMutation      NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)
 * PatchMutation      null                  null
 * TransformMutation  Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * TransformMutation  NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)
 * TransformMutation  null                  null
 * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)          NoDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     null                  NoDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes
 * have no explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the
 * updated version.
 *
 * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being
 * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is
 * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation
 * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior
 * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not
 * necessarily for a PatchMutation).
